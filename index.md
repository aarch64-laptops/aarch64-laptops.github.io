# Introducing the laptops

* Lenovo Yoga C630 WoS: 😭 ❓
* [Thinkpad X13s: 🐧 🔗](laptops/thinkpad_x13s/thinkpad_x13s.md)


Key:

😭 : This is an interesting laptop but no documentation currently exists in this repo (pull requests are very welcome)

🐧 : Upstream Linux kernel supports fundamental hardware features. Different
     developers will have different opinions about what hardware is (and is
     not) fundamental. On this page fundamental means support for at least:
     keyboard, trackpad, display, WiFi, built-in storage. More informally
     this hardware translates to "might be able to do useful work in a coffee
     shop".

📗 : Includes a detailed and beginner friendly step-by-step install guide

🔗 : Has links to distro specific guides and/or additional community resources.
